# **Server-Monitoring-System**

## Overview

The Servers Monitoring System is designed to monitor server health, track status changes, and send real-time notifications. This solution integrates with a PostgreSQL database, using functions, triggers, and a Node.js backend to provide alerts based on server health.

The server follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

## **ðŸ“‚ Project Structure**
```
/Server-Monitoring-System
â”‚â”€â”€ /server      # Backend (Node.js/Express)
â”‚â”€â”€ /client      # Frontend (React + Vite or CRA)
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md    # Documentation
```

## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repository**
```
git [clone <your-github-repo-url>](https://github.com/ShaniStaretz/Server-Monitoring-System.git)
cd Server-Monitoring-System
```

---

## **ðŸ›  Backend Setup (Server)**
Navigate to the `server` folder and install dependencies:
```
cd server
npm install
```
### **Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file inside `server/` with necessary variables:
```
PORT=your_app_port # or default value will take place =3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=server-monitoring-system
DB_PORT=5432

EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_provider
EMAIL_recipient=your_email_address_recipient
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key # or default value will take place
```
### **Start the Backend**
```
npm start   # For normal start
```
The server will run on **`http://localhost:5000`** (or your configured port).
This will launch the Node.js server on http://localhost:5000, or your selected port.
---

## **Frontend Setup (Client)**
Navigate to the `client` folder and install dependencies:
```
cd ../client
npm install
```
### **ðŸ”§ Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file inside `client/`:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
### **Start the Frontend**
```sh
npm run start  # (For Vite)
```
The frontend will run on **`http://localhost:5173`** (or default React port).

---

## **ðŸš€ Running Both Server & Client Together**
You can run both frontend and backend in parallel using **concurrently**:
1. Install `concurrently` in the root folder:
   ```sh
   npm install -g concurrently
   ```
2. Add this script inside the root `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "concurrently \"cd server && npm run dev\" \"cd client && npm run dev\""
   }
   ```
3. Run:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
This will start both the frontend and backend simultaneously.

        Example:
         ```
          curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/servers
         ```
    * **Get server by ID:**
        Endpoint: GET /servers/:serverId
        Description: Retrieves the all details of a specific server and it's 10 first monitory log history by its ID.
      
        Example:
         ```
          curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/servers/1
         ```

        Example:
         ```
          curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/history/1
         ```
         
    * **Get if  a server was Healthy by given TimeStamp**:
        Endpoint GET history/health-status/:serverId? timestamp=
        Description: Returns True and in the giving timestamp the server was healthy, else return False.
        * URL Parameters:
            *serverId (path parameter) â€“ The unique identifier of the server whose health status history you wish to retrieve.
            * timestamp (query parameter) â€“ The timestamp to fetch the health status from the history. It should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
              
        * **Add new server:**
            Endpoint: POST /servers/
            Description: Add new server for monitor
            * Request Body:
                The request body should be a JSON object that includes the necessary server information: server_name,port,protocol_name,username, password.
              
                Body Example:
                ```

                   http://localhost:5000/servers/1
                 ```
          
   * **delete server by ID:**
       Endpoint: DELETE /servers/:serverId
       Description: Delete an exist server from the system, including its records from the monitory history.
     
       Example:
                 ```
                   curl -X DELETE  http://localhost:5000/servers/1
                 ```
## optional Endpoint usages:
* **Test Monitorying System**:
    Endpoint: GET /
    Description: Verify the server is up and running.
  
    Example:
                 ```
                   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/
                 ```

## Triggers & Notifications
The system uses PostgreSQL triggers to update server statuses.
* update current status of the server to be 'Healthy' if last 5 monitory logs are 'Success'.
* update current status of the server to be 'Unhealthy' if last 3 monitory logs are 'Failed'
* if current status of the server is 'Unhealthy' the system will send notification alerts accordingly.

Ensure your PostgreSQL database is set up with all necessary functions, triggers, and tables.

## Limitations:
* Protocol name needs to be one if the following options: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH.
* server name needs to include the domain and the Top-Level Domain (TLD):
    Example:www.example.com, httpbin.org
* no 2 servers with the same server name.
  
## Troubleshooting
* "Server not found" error: Verify your PostgreSQL database connection settings in the .env file.
* Email notifications not working: Make sure your SMTP credentials are valid and that your SMTP provider supports external connections.
* Trigger or function creation errors: Ensure that the functions and triggers have been properly created in your PostgreSQL database.


## *** **updated project** ***:
* the server can be any string possible, but still UNIQUE in the DB
* removed from servers_list the port and protocol_id fields, no need for them to check connection with the remote server.
* the worker get all servers from the DB, for each server splite server_url and get the protocol and the port automatically.
* left the protocols_list table and it's functions related.
